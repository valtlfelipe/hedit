3.  **Right-click** on the `Hedit.app` icon in your Applications folder.
4.  Select **"Open"** from the context menu.
5.  If a warning dialog appears stating "Hedit.app cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer," click **"Open"** again.
6.  If the app still doesn't open, go to **System Settings** (or System Preferences) > **Privacy & Security**.
7.  Scroll down to the "Security" section. You should see a message like "Hedit.app was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer."

9.  You will be prompted to confirm. Click **"Open"**.

The application should now launch successfully.
